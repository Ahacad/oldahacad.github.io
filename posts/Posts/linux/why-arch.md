description: "Why should you use Arch Linux"
---

One of my friends said he wants to go back to Windows, after using Arch Linux for a fairly long amount of time. This makes me wonder: why should I use Arch Linux? Is it just for showing off? Or maybe it means something more than that?

I started using arch, immitaing some programmers on video websites like Youtube and Bilibili. Instantly I know that I want this OS, because I had always had an urge to make my computer customized, by me.
