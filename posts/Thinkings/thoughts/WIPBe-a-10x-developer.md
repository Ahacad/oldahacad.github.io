There are many clever peolpe in this world, some **observe** and find
the meaning of everyday things, like writers and philosophers, some
**analyze** and try to get some universal truthes, like physicists.
Developers, however, focus on **actions**, they don't just learn
theories, they put what they learn from books into programs, into
everyday things, into companies, and into anything you can ever think
of.
