You can easily burden yourself with tons of works without finishing anything, but just to get the feeling that “I am doing something that would make me feel good”. This is not true.</p>\n<p>That might make you feel good, for a short period of time, but in the long run, or even in the “middle run”, you will be doomed. Actually get something done - that’s simple but not easy.</p>\n<p>I am also on the road of being more productive, this might be an infinite journey, but any proceed will make things better.</p>\n<p>One useful suggestion is that “build your infrastructure”, which are the things that you will be using everyday, make them as efficent as possible as they will be used many, many, many times. Personally I now have OKR, kanban, and daily todo list as the working infrastructure (of course I am still improving, look at <a href=\"https://github.com/ahacad/infrastructure\">this repo</a>), I encourage you to make something that you use everyday as efficient as possible (or even automate them), thy shall benefit a lot. :)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Don't be pseudo-worker","date":"November 09, 2020","description":"Really finish something"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/management/pseudo-worker/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/thoughts/money-makes-life-so-much-easier/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Money makes life so much easier"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1246554614","2841359383"]}
