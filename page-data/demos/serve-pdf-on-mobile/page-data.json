I am not that insane (for the sake of my eyes), but it’s definitely needed to read pdf files on mobile.</p>\n<p>Sadly my android chrome doesn’t support this. I tried to get around with it using google drive for pdf previewing like this: <code class=\"language-text\">https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=yoururlonserver</code>, that was OK, but the connection tends to be slow, and I’d prefer hosting things myself. Better find another way around.</p>\n<p>So here it is: <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js\">pdf.js by mozilla</a>, this totally solved my problem. And I also found : <a href=\"https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-pdf\">a descendant project using react</a>. I am currently working on making the demos, you should also give it a shot!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Serve pdf on mobile","date":"November 06, 2020","description":"It's really annoying that I cannot view pdf on my mobile due to browser compatibility problems, finally found a way to solve this."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/demos/serve-pdf-on-mobile/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/demos/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Building My Blog"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1246554614","2841359383"]}
